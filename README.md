# COMS3930 Module 1

The code in this repository belongs to the Module 1 ESP32 Generative Art Display for COMS 3930. A longer description of the project, including the creative choices, can be found here: https://medium.com/@emilydringel/esp32-generative-art-display-fca602560362. 

The code in this repository was uploaded to the ESP32 device using Arduino and a USB-C cord. 

The hardware for the device included an ESP32 device, a battery, a paper envelope (drawn on with a black pen), thread, and a popsicle stick. The battery is soldered to wires that connect to and power the display. The paper envelope is folded and taped to hold and hide the device and battery. The envelope is suspended from the ceiling with thread and a popsicle stick. The largest challenges with the display were soldering the wires and generating the code.
